              "' Praise be to Allah. Praise be to Allah who taught with a pen. He taught man what he did not know. And who created everything and estimated it with appreciation. And peace and blessings be upon you. I seek refuge with Allah from the virtue of knowledge and His people. Praise be to Allah and praise be to Allah. Indeed, our religion is the religion of Islam, the religion of knowledge and knowledge. Where Islam came and the nations were lost in the Quran So this verse was the first light in this dark night. Then the believing verses came to light that this religion is the religion of the knowledge of the blind. So he invites his people to the knowledge and dispels them from the darkness. So the Ummah turned into the Ummah of knowledge and light. Allah Almighty said worship the chosen face except with knowledge. The Ummah cannot be straight on the correct path except with knowledge. My beloved in Allah, there are many Quranic verses and many prophetic hadiths, all of them are doubtless that those who are given knowledge are the best in this nation forever. As Allah says, Allah raises those who believe from you and those who give knowledge in degrees. Some interpreters say in this verse, Allah raises the believer who is a scholar to the believer who is not a scholar. The people of knowledge are those who fear Allah on the face of this noble verse, we will realize that the secret of Sharia. They have been proud of the worldly sciences over the religious sciences and they are proud of it. Although the pride and the virtue of the religious knowledge that makes it easy for its owner to go to the way to which Allah Almighty said Allah Almighty ordered us to increase knowledge and it is sufficient for knowledge. Allah Almighty ordered His Prophet to say, and say my Lord increase me knowledge He always encourages his companions to learn the Sharia knowledge. He said in a hadith, the Prophet said, and does not decrease the level of honor and dignity. A little of it benefits and a lot of it makes him proud and exalts. A treasure that is purified in every way and that is more than the benefit. And neither does he be angry nor is he afraid of a thief or a thief. So he strived to obtain it and he was able to overcome the difficulty in his memorization and his teaching, and he put the long line in his collection, and he put the effort in his narrations and his interpretation, and then he moved on to his understanding and his interpretation. Dear beloved ones, there are many texts, and many evidences, and clear ev clear, which is a sign of his honour and honour in both houses. If I had taken all of them to you, this time would not have been enough for me. So, I conclude my speech with this great speech, which is from Allah, the Exalted, that He makes us and you among those who listen to the speech and follow the best and the last of our supplication. All praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds.'"
